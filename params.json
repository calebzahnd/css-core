  "name": "Core",
  "tagline": "Core is a very simple, lightweight alternative to larger frameworks such as Bootstrap and grid systems like Susy. It is an opinionated system, built with the belief that markup should be mean and lean and layout should be controlled in stylesheets, not a bunch of classes.",
  "body": "### Easy to manage media queries\r\nIn Core, we try to limit breakpoints to a just a few predefined widths. These are easily managed via a Sass Map in the base/_variables.scss partial.\r\n```\r\n    $grid-breakpoints: (\r\n        xs: 0,\r\n        sm: 544px,\r\n        md: 768px,\r\n        lg: 992px,\r\n        xl: 1200px\r\n    );\r\n```\r\nMedia queries are dead simple to call in your Sass using the `screen()` mixin. Simply add `@include screen(md){}` to your declarations and add your declarations inside the brackets.\r\n\r\n### Bird's Eye Z-Index\r\nZ-Index is one of the easiest way to get a mess started in your code. With Core, we manage Z-Index easily by calling them all from a Sass Map. All z-indexes should be named in the $z-index map:\r\n```\r\n    $z-index: (\r\n        heaven\t\t:\t9999,\r\n        modal\t\t:\t5000,\r\n        aboveground\t:\t100,\r\n        ground\t\t:\t1,\r\n        zero\t\t:\t0,\r\n        underground\t:\t-1,\r\n        hell\t\t:\t-9000\r\n    );\r\n```\r\nZ-indexes are then easily called using `@include z-index(ground);`\r\n\r\n### Much more documentation to come\r\nThis is just enough to get you started. But there's much more under the hood. Like...\r\n\r\n### Automatic REM font sizing with PX fallback.\r\n`@include font-size(16px);`\r\n\r\n### Dead simple grid system.\r\nEasily set any number of columns and parent width for any element. Like a boss.\r\n\r\n### Built in support for Flexbox grids.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCaleb Zahnd (@calebzahnd) started the project in the summer of 2016.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble? [Contact Caleb](https://twitter.com/calebzahnd) and we'll help you sort it out. More comprehensive documentation coming when I have time.\r\n",
